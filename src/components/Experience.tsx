          I completed Alkemy's React Acceleration Program, which consisted
          in the development of a website and CMS for the ONG "Somos MÃ¡s". The
          project was done with a team of eight members and we used agile
          methodologies (SCRUM) and Jira + Bitbucket for the code management.
          The project was built with React, Redux, Bootstrap and tested with
          Jest and React Testing Library.
